# Abstract
* We demonstrate a vehicle wiper control system using the STM32F4xx-discovery board in this project. Because the STM32F4xx-discovery lacks a motor, we're looking at utilising LEDs to control the wipers. The wiper control system, for instance. A Push Button and four LEDs are on the STM32F4xx-discovery board. Orange, green, red, and blue are the colours of these LEDs. Four user LEDs are connected to the PORTD pins PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 on the Discovery board via a current limiting resistor. The GPIO pins will be set to digital input pins to make a push button function with the STM32F407VG microcontroller. The Red light will flash for two seconds if you press and hold the user button. When the ignition switch is turned on,
*A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method needed manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this strategy is suggested as a solution to these problems. The project's purpose is to provide automatic transmission to older cars in order to enhance their systems.
wiping system, to improve the system by adding a sensor and an actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would function seamlessly with the framework.
The idea of this suggested wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers.
